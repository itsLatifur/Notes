# React Basics

I understand React as a **component-based JavaScript library** for building user interfaces.

* Component-based means we **break the UI into small reusable pieces** called components.
* The same component can be reused in multiple places.
* UI logic is grouped by **component**, not separated strictly into HTML, CSS, and JS files.
* Each component controls its own structure, logic, and behavior.

---

# Hooks

React uses the **`use`** prefix so React can **identify and track hooks internally**.
Hooks allow **function components** to:

* Store state
* Run side effects
* Use React features without using class components

Hooks **must**:

* Start with `use`
* Be called at the **top level** of a component (not inside loops or conditions)

---

## `useState`

* `useState` is used to **store and update state** inside a function component.

**Example:**

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

I understand this as:

* `const []` is **array destructuring**, not just a constant array.
* `count` holds the **current value** of the state.
* `setCount` is a function used to **update the state**.
* We should **never update state directly**, like `count = count + 1`, because:

  * React will not detect the change
  * The component will not re-render
* `useState(0)` creates a piece of state and sets its **initial value** to `0`

`useState` returns:

* A state variable
* A function to update that variable

When `setCount` is called:

* React updates the state internally
* React **re-renders the component**
* The UI updates automatically based on the new state

**Example:**

```js
setCount(count + 1);
```

---

## `useEffect`

`useEffect` is used to **run side effects** — code that runs **because something happened**, not directly during rendering.

Common use cases:

* Log something when a component loads or updates
* Fetch data from an API
* Run code after a state or prop changes
* Clean up tasks (like removing event listeners)

### Dependency Array Behavior

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

* Runs **only once** when the component mounts (first render)

```js
useEffect(() => {}, [state]);
```

* Runs:

  * Once on mount
  * Again **whenever `state` changes**

```js
useEffect(() => {});
```

* Runs **after every render**
* Can cause performance issues if used carelessly

---

# `const` and Mutability

I understand that:

* `const` variables **cannot be reassigned**
* But **objects and arrays declared with `const` can have their internal values changed** in plain JavaScript

Example (JavaScript):

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // allowed in JS
```

But in **React state**:

* We should **not mutate state directly**
* Even methods like `push()` should be avoided
* React relies on **new references** to detect changes

Correct way in React:

```js
setArr([...arr, 4]);
```

---

# Spread Operator (`...`)

The spread operator is used to **create a new copy** of arrays or objects and update only the values we want.

This helps React **detect state changes properly**.

### Array Example

```js
setId([1, ...nums, 6]);
```

Where:

```js
nums = [2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Result:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

### Object Example

```js
const student = {
  id: 22103280,
  program: "BCSE",
  age: 22,
  sec: "A"
};

const student1 = {
  ...student,
  id: 22103281,
  age: 21
};
```

Here:

* Only `id` and `age` are changed
* All other properties remain the same

---

# Export and Import

I understand that:

* I can export a function, variable, or component using `export`
* After exporting, I can use `import` in another file

### Named Export

```js
export const MyComponent = () => {};
```

Import using curly braces:

```js
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";
```

### Default Export

```js
export default MyComponent;
```

Import **without** curly braces:

```js
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```

---

# Fetch API and Async

* I have experience with `async` in **ASP.NET APIs**
* JavaScript is **single-threaded**, but it handles async tasks using:

  * Event loop
  * Promises
  * Async / Await

### Fetch in React

Fetch is usually called inside `useEffect`.

---

### GET Request

Steps:

* Pass the URL to `fetch()`
* Use `await` to wait for the response
* Convert JSON → JavaScript object using `response.json()`
* Store the result in state

Example:

```js
const response = await fetch(url);
const data = await response.json();
setData(data);
```

---

### POST Request

Steps:

* Provide the URL
* Set method to `POST`
* Add headers with `Content-Type: application/json`
* Convert JavaScript object → JSON using `JSON.stringify()`

Example:

```js
await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(user)
});
```
